# FPGA-Lab
Field-Programmable Gate Array Labs is a set of course projects which implements different functions and meets specific requirements such as counting or monitoring.<br>
Based on Spartan-3E_FPGA_Starter_Kit_Board.<br>
Written in Verilog.
## File Description
Each folder represents a lab, containing 3 or 4 types of files:
* instruction: explain the environment, brief process and final goals
* .v: codes written in Verilog
* .ucf: user constraints file
* report: some labs may contain a report, which describes the lab in details
